Array-oriented static site generator in APL. "iota" (⍳) — The generator of indices. A site engine where content is a vector and transformations are pure array-logic.

=== Who Is This For?

    APL/Dyalog developers who treat content as high-dimensional data.

    Systems Engineers deploying to Minix, ASICs, or Edge tech where binary size and execution speed are critical.

    Architects needing to bridge legacy array-logic with modern ReScript/Deno orchestration via MCP.

=== Why iota-ssg?

==== Array-Oriented Templates Templates are not string interpolations; they are functions mapped across content arrays. By leveraging ⍳, iota-ssg generates site structures with O(1) index-based access.

==== Massive Parallelism Because APL operations are inherently vectorised, iota-ssg synthesises thousands of pages simultaneously. It is the fastest engine in the poly-ssg family for high-volume documentation.

==== Rank-Based Routing Define your site hierarchy through array rank. Nested folders are simply higher-rank dimensions in your content matrix. No more recursive file-system crawls.

==== Zero-Overhead Metadata Frontmatter is parsed into typed arrays. Use Nickel to define the schema, and iota-ssg will ensure your site shape matches your data shape at compile-time.
=== Quick Start [source,oil]
Install via asdf

asdf install iota-ssg latest
Create a site (Uses ReScript/Deno wrapper)

just init my-array-site
Build with APL core (Defaults to Podman)

just build
Inspect the content rank
just inspect

=== Features

    Vectorised Site Logic: High-throughput generation via array-logic core.

    ReScript Bridge: Safe, functional interface for Deno and MCP consumers.

    Podman-First: Containerised builds for Linux, Minix, and PC.

    Accessibility: Native metadata for BSL, GSL, ASL, and Makaton.

=== Requirements

    Dyalog APL or GNU APL

    Deno (for ReScript adapters)

    Just (for task orchestration)

=== Part of poly-ssg iota-ssg is the array-native member of the poly-ssg family, providing extreme performance through mathematical density.

=== License AGPL-3.0-or-later
